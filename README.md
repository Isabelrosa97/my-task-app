PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

For Project3 I created a task manager app that allows users to write down different tasks, as well as, deleting tasks, and marking tasks as complete or incomplete. The task app has two pages consisting of the todo page and the contact page. In the contact page users are able to write down their information and leave any comments or concerns.


PROJECT DETAILS 

- In the todos page, the user can use the input box to add any new tasks they need to complete. The input box has a placeholder so users know where to ass the tasks. Next to the box is a Add button so the tasks will show up in the sections below the input box. Under the input box there are 3 sections with tabs labeled All, Complete, Incomplete. This allows the user to view all the tasks they've written, and view which ones are completed and incomplete . These tasks are filtered for better organization. 

- In the contacts page, there are fields for the user to input their first name, last name, email, and any comments or concerns the user may have. Each input box is labaled with what needs to be written inside. Each field is required so there is no missing information so the users needs can be satisfied. There is a send button at the bottom of the form that can be clicked when the user is done or there is a clear button that can be clicked if the user wants to delete any information written in the form. 


TECHNOLOGIES USED :

USER STORIES :

-  As a user , I want to create new tasks easily. Once I type in my task and press enter, I want to be able to see what I wrote clearly and immediately.
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete or incomplete so I can easily see which tasks I  have left to do.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a task if I no longer need to do it so I wont get confused when looking at my task list.
